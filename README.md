# Description :

A simple AI for nine mens morris using minimax and alphabeta pruning algorithms build from scratch for educational perposes.
This project presents my very first contact with artificial intelligence field, it also contants two console versions of the 
game to illustrate the difference between minimax and alphabeta in term of how much nodes every one processes.

This game is build from scratch using C++ language, it also contains a graphic and an android version build with cocos2d framework, 
the two players mode of the game in the graphic version is build using alphabeta pruning search algorithm and
 it plays pertty well game in the in-game.
